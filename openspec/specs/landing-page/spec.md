# Landing Page Specification

> **Change**: `sprint-7-ui-fidelity` + `sprint-8-polish-testing-backlog` + `sprint-9-audit-calibration` + `sprint-10-free-mode` + `sprint-11-rebrand-polish` + `sprint-12-dogfood-geo-score` + `sprint-13-brand-authority` + `sprint-19-schema-up` + `sprint-20-close-free` · **Type**: New capability (ADDED) + Delta (MODIFIED + ADDED)

## Purpose

The marketing landing page re-implemented 1:1 with Gemini's composition: a hero with the URL input and "Run Audit" button **inside** the field plus sample URLs, a five-card feature row with contrasting backgrounds (card 03 on dark navy with emerald number), a demo ScoreHero + band table using the **real** thresholds (90/75/60/40), and the six AI platforms. It is the anonymous entry point to the free audit flow. Since Sprint 8, the page is session-aware (the primary CTA adapts via `auth()`, Home becomes dynamic), the demo ScoreHero shows a REAL score from `runAudit()` against candidate URLs with its honest band (never an invented number), and OpenGraph/Twitter metadata is emitted (LND-6/LND-7/LND-8). Since Sprint 10, the pricing teaser and "Ver Planes" CTA are removed; the anonymous CTA repoints to signup/audit (e.g. "Auditar gratis"). Since Sprint 11, the JSON-LD `name`/`sameAs`/`url` reference the Relevy brand and the `relevy` repo (LND-9), and `llms.txt` carries the Relevy brand with `relevy.app` and the accurate 10/30-day free limit (LND-10). Since Sprint 12, the Organization JSON-LD carries the full recommended property set (`knowsAbout`, `founder`, `address`, `contactPoint`, `email`, `foundingDate` — LND-9), and the landing shows a visible FAQ with real questions plus `datePublished`/byline/alt (LND-13; FAQPage JSON-LD intentionally omitted as a product decision — the schema engine docks FAQPage as deprecated under RSC-7). Since Sprint 13, the landing copy describes the six GEO dimensions with their weights (LND-11 adds the 50-200 word band), the feature grid gains a 6th "Autoridad de marca" card (20%), the FAQ reaches 6 recognizable questions with question-form H2/H3 headings (LND-13), and a comparison table with real Relevy facts (LND-14) renders between the platforms and the FAQ. Since Sprint 15, the copy weight references are synced to v3.1.0 (24/23/15/12/14/12, brand "12 %"/"octava parte" — LND-15), the hero subtitle lists the six dimensions by name without percentages (LND-11), and the comparison table scrolls horizontally on mobile while preserving semantic `<table>` markup (LND-14). Since Sprint 16, the author byline moved to the global footer with the `.byline` class so the expertise engine detects it over the full DOM (LND-13), the founder Person carries the real `sameAs` profiles (LND-9), the six platform cards carry 2-4 sentence 50-200 word descriptions with concrete verified stats (LND-4), and the landing gains Case Study (LND-16) and Changelog (LND-17) sections between the comparison table and the FAQ. Since Sprint 17, the Organization JSON-LD adds the real `areaServed` "AR" / `industry` "Software" / `numberOfEmployees` 1 values and omits the invented `award` (LND-9, honesty LND-7 — `missing_recommended` drops 4 → 1), and the landing interleaves gray/white section backgrounds that break the four-gray run (S4/S5b white `rounded-2xl` recuadros on the gray base, S5/S6 white `border-y` bands) while keeping exactly 6 `rounded-xl` platform cards and the `overflow-x-auto` table wrapper (LND-18). Since Sprint 20, the OpenGraph image is the regenerated Relevy mark (og.png 1200×630, hash ≠ pre-rebrand default — LND-8), an honest launch section renders between the FAQ and the final CTA (LND-20.1), and the five starter SVGs without a consumer are removed from `public/` (LND-20.2).

### Requirement: Hero Form Inline (LND-1)

When the landing page renders, then the hero MUST present a single input field that contains the "Run Audit" button inside it, plus tappable sample URLs that pre-fill the input.

#### Scenario: Button inside the input

- GIVEN the landing hero
- WHEN it renders
- THEN the submit button sits inside the URL field (not stacked below)

#### Scenario: Sample URLs pre-fill

- GIVEN the landing hero
- WHEN a sample URL chip is activated
- THEN the input is pre-filled with that URL

### Requirement: Contrast Cards 01-05 (LND-2)

When the feature section renders, then it MUST show five numbered cards (01-05) with contrasting backgrounds, where card 03 uses the dark navy background with an emerald accent number.

#### Scenario: Card 03 is navy

- GIVEN the feature row
- WHEN it renders
- THEN card 03 has a dark navy (`#0f172a`) background with an emerald number

### Requirement: Scorecard Demo (LND-3)

When the demo scorecard renders, then it MUST present a sample GEO score with its band and a band table whose thresholds are the **real** ones (90/75/60/40) — never Gemini's 80/65/45/25.

#### Scenario: Real thresholds shown

- GIVEN the demo band table
- WHEN it renders
- THEN bands are labeled Excellent ≥90, Good ≥75, Fair ≥60, Poor ≥40, Critical <40

### Requirement: Six Platforms (LND-4)

When the landing page renders, then it MUST surface the six AI platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini, Google AI Overviews, Bing Copilot). Each platform card MUST carry a description of 2-4 sentences (50-200 words, the citability extraction band) that is answer-first (states the platform's AI-search behavior in the first sentence, explicit subject — no pronoun/conjunction lead) and self-contained, and MUST include at least one concrete stat drawn from the verified product facts (17 agents, 6 platforms, <30s per URL, semver engine versions, 2026). The platform name, crawler bot, company, and H3 titles MUST remain unchanged (exact-match tests). No invented or unverified stats.
(Previously: each platform card carried a single-sentence description (~35 words, no stats) — the six blocks scored ~26 in citability.)

#### Scenario: Six platform logos/names

- GIVEN the landing page
- WHEN it renders
- THEN the six platforms are shown

#### Scenario: Bot, company and H3 titles unchanged

- GIVEN the platforms section
- WHEN it renders
- THEN each card still shows its exact bot and company strings (GPTBot / OAI-SearchBot, ClaudeBot / Anthropic-AI, PerplexityBot, Google-Extended, Googlebot Smartphone, Bingbot / IndexNow)
- AND the H3 titles are untouched (asserted by `page.test.tsx`)

#### Scenario: Answer-first descriptions in the 50-200 word band

- GIVEN each platform card description
- WHEN it is inspected
- THEN it is 2-4 sentences and between 50 and 200 words
- AND it leads with an explicit subject and carries at least one concrete stat

#### Scenario: No invented stats

- GIVEN the six platform descriptions
- WHEN their numbers are inspected
- THEN every stat traces to verified product facts (17 agents, 6 platforms, <30s, semver versions, 2026)
- AND no fabricated figure appears

### Requirement: GEO Engine Badge (LND-5)

When the hero renders, then it MUST show a "GEO Engine" badge above/beside the headline.

#### Scenario: Badge visible

- GIVEN the hero
- WHEN it renders
- THEN the "GEO Engine" badge is visible

### Requirement: Authenticated CTA (LND-6)

When the Home page renders, then it MUST call `auth()` (making Home dynamic) and adapt the CTA: with an active session the CTA reads "Ir al dashboard", and without a session it reads a signup/audit CTA (e.g. "Auditar gratis"). There is no pricing teaser or "Ver Planes" CTA.

#### Scenario: Logged-in user sees dashboard CTA

- GIVEN an active session
- WHEN Home renders
- THEN the primary CTA reads "Ir al dashboard"

#### Scenario: Anonymous visitor sees audit CTA

- GIVEN no session
- WHEN Home renders
- THEN the primary CTA reads a signup/audit CTA (e.g. "Auditar gratis")
- AND no pricing link is present

### Requirement: Veracious ScoreHero (LND-7)

When the landing ScoreHero renders, then it MUST display a real GEO score obtained by running `runAudit()` against candidate URLs, and it MUST present verified evidence — the score, an `auditDate`, and `categoryScores` breakdown — sourced from a real run, never a placeholder or invented number.
(Previously: real score required but evidence fields were placeholders — A3.2 open.)

#### Scenario: Verified evidence shown

- GIVEN a real `runAudit()` result for the best candidate URL
- WHEN the ScoreHero renders
- THEN it shows the score with its `auditDate` and `categoryScores` breakdown
- AND no placeholder value appears

#### Scenario: No candidate reaches 90+

- GIVEN the best real score is 85
- WHEN the ScoreHero renders
- THEN it shows 85 in the "good" band with honest copy, never a fabricated ≥90

### Requirement: OG/SEO Tags (LND-8)

When the landing page renders, then it MUST emit OpenGraph and Twitter card metadata via the shared OG helper (reusing the default metadata with OG fields added), and the OpenGraph image MUST be the regenerated Relevy mark.
(Previously: `og.png` was the pre-rebrand asset from 2026-08-25; the OpenGraph image is now regenerated with the Relevy mark, referenced from `src/app/icon.svg`.)

#### Scenario: OG + Twitter tags present

- GIVEN the landing page
- WHEN it renders
- THEN `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image`, and Twitter card tags are present

#### Scenario: og.png is the current Relevy mark

- GIVEN `public/og.png`
- WHEN it is inspected
- THEN it exists at 1200×630
- AND its content hash differs from the pre-rebrand default (`9e854ba0…`), matching the Relevy mark in `src/app/icon.svg`
- AND the human visual verification is documented in `verify-report`

#### Scenario: OG helper still references /og.png

- GIVEN `src/lib/og.ts`
- WHEN `OG_IMAGE` is inspected
- THEN it still points to `/og.png` at 1200×630
- AND the JSON-LD `logo`/`image` still reference the same asset

### Requirement: JSON-LD Organization (LND-9)

When the landing page renders, then it MUST emit `Organization` and `WebSite` structured data via a `<script type="application/ld+json">` block with `name` "Relevy", `url` the production domain (`relevy.app`), and `sameAs` linking the GitHub repo `relevy`. The `Organization` node MUST additionally include `knowsAbout`, `founder`, `address`, `contactPoint`, `email`, `foundingDate`, `areaServed` ("AR"), `industry` ("Software"), and `numberOfEmployees` (1), populated with real Relevy data (nothing invented, LND-7). The nested `founder` Person node MUST carry `sameAs` referencing the same real profiles as `ORG_SAME_AS` — a distinct expertise signal (+2) even though the authoritativeness engine deduplicates the URLs (no authoritativeness gain, no invented profiles). `ORG_SAME_AS` MUST contain EXACTLY five real, verifiable profiles: the three existing (github.com/ezefernandezyf, linkedin.com/in/ezequiel-fernandez-59a21a387, ezefernandez.com) plus `https://www.tiktok.com/@ezefernandezdev` and `https://github.com/ezefernandezyf/relevy`, so `countValidSameAs` returns 15 (5×3). The Organization node MUST NOT emit an `award` property — no real award exists and inventing one would violate LND-7; the schema engine keeps reporting `missing_recommended` for `award` (accepted honesty-over-score tradeoff).
(Previously: `ORG_SAME_AS` had exactly three profiles, so `countValidSameAs` returned 9 (3×3).)

#### Scenario: Relevy Organization + WebSite

- GIVEN the landing page
- WHEN it renders
- THEN the JSON-LD `name` is "Relevy" and `sameAs`/`url` reference Relevy (no "GeoAudit")

#### Scenario: Recommended properties populated with real data

- GIVEN the landing JSON-LD `Organization` node
- WHEN it is inspected
- THEN `knowsAbout`, `founder`, `address`, `contactPoint`, `email`, `foundingDate`, `areaServed`, `industry`, and `numberOfEmployees` are present
- AND every value traces to real Relevy data (verified `sameAs` URLs, real founder/address/contact, country "AR", industry "Software", 1 employee — no placeholders)

#### Scenario: Founder Person carries the five real sameAs profiles

- GIVEN the `Organization` node's nested `founder` Person
- WHEN its properties are inspected
- THEN `sameAs` equals `ORG_SAME_AS` with exactly five entries: github.com/ezefernandezyf, linkedin.com/in/ezequiel-fernandez-59a21a387, ezefernandez.com, www.tiktok.com/@ezefernandezdev, github.com/ezefernandezyf/relevy
- AND no invented handle appears (updated `toEqual`/`toMatchObject` in `brand.test.ts` and `page.test.tsx`)

#### Scenario: No authoritativeness double-count

- GIVEN the `sameAs` URLs across Organization and Person nodes
- WHEN `sameAsUrls` collects them
- THEN the set is deduplicated — the Person `sameAs` add no new URLs, so authoritativeness is unchanged

#### Scenario: Real org attributes trace to brand constants

- GIVEN the `Organization` node
- WHEN `areaServed`, `industry`, and `numberOfEmployees` are inspected
- THEN they equal "AR", "Software", and 1 respectively
- AND each value comes from a `brand.ts` constant (`ORG_AREA_SERVED`, `ORG_INDUSTRY`, `ORG_EMPLOYEES`) — never a hardcoded literal in the page

#### Scenario: sameAs scores 15/15 with five real profiles

- GIVEN the `Organization` node's `sameAs` and the nested `founder` Person's `sameAs`
- WHEN `countValidSameAs` runs across all flattened nodes
- THEN it returns 15 (5 profiles × 3 nodes flattened, deduplicated)
- AND no invented handle appears in either array

#### Scenario: No invented award

- GIVEN the `Organization` node
- WHEN it is inspected
- THEN no `award` property is present
- AND the schema engine still reports `missing_recommended` for `award` (honesty over score, LND-7) — the `missing_recommended` count stays 1

### Requirement: Crawl/AI Assets (LND-10)

When the site serves static assets, then the landing MUST expose `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, and `llms.txt` at the site root. `llms.txt` MUST reference the Relevy brand and `relevy.app` domain and MUST state the accurate free limit (10 audits / 30 days), not the stale "3 auditorías mensuales".
(Previously: assets served at root; llms.txt carried the GeoAudit brand and a stale 3-audit claim.)

#### Scenario: Assets served at root

- GIVEN a request to `/robots.txt`, `/sitemap.xml`, and `/llms.txt`
- WHEN each is fetched
- THEN each returns 200 with valid content

#### Scenario: llms.txt is Relevy-accurate

- GIVEN `public/llms.txt`
- WHEN its content is inspected
- THEN it names Relevy, links `relevy.app`, and states the 10/30-day limit

### Requirement: Citable Passages (LND-11)

When the hero and feature sections render, then the copy MUST be answer-first (definition/claim in the first 1-2 sentences), MUST include concrete statistics, and each passage MUST sit in the 50-200 word band (the citability engine's extraction band) so passages are self-contained and citable. The hero subtitle MUST list the six dimensions by NAME only, without percentages, and the full hero passage MUST remain at or above the 50-word floor of the band after the subtitle is shortened.
(Previously: hero subtitle listed the six v3.0.0 weights with percentages.)

#### Scenario: Answer-first copy with stats

- GIVEN the landing hero and feature cards
- WHEN their copy is inspected
- THEN each block leads with an answer/claim and carries at least one concrete stat

#### Scenario: Passages in the 50-200 word band

- GIVEN each hero/feature passage
- WHEN its word count is measured
- THEN it contains between 50 and 200 words
- AND the hero passage remains ≥50 words with the shortened subtitle

#### Scenario: Hero subtitle is names-only

- GIVEN the hero subtitle
- WHEN its content is inspected
- THEN it names the six dimensions without percentages (e.g. "citabilidad, E-E-A-T, acceso de bots, autoridad de marca, datos estructurados y plataforma")
- AND no percentage value appears in the subtitle

### Requirement: E-E-A-T Signals (LND-12)

When the landing renders, then it MUST surface trust and authority signals: legal links (terms/privacy), contact information, and HTTPS-only links.

#### Scenario: Trust signals present

- GIVEN the landing footer
- WHEN it renders
- THEN terms, privacy, and contact links are present and all internal links are HTTPS

### Requirement: Content Signals (LND-13)

When the landing renders, then it MUST surface structured content signals: a visible FAQ section with 5+ recognizable questions (FAQPage JSON-LD intentionally NOT emitted — product decision, RSC-7); H2/H3 content headings phrased as questions; `datePublished` on content sections with real dates; an author byline rendered by the GLOBAL FOOTER (moved out of the FAQ block, with class `.byline` so the expertise engine's `AUTHOR_SELECTOR` detects it over the full DOM); and descriptive `alt` text on every image. The byline is no longer part of the `<Page/>` render — it MUST be asserted in the shell/footer render.
(Previously: author byline inside the FAQ block with no `.byline` class — the +5 expertise byline bonus was never detected.)

#### Scenario: FAQ with 5+ recognizable questions, FAQPage JSON-LD omitted

- GIVEN the landing page
- WHEN it renders
- THEN a visible FAQ section with at least 5 questions in recognizable question form is present
- AND no `@type` FAQPage JSON-LD block is emitted (asserted by `page.test.tsx`)

#### Scenario: Question-form H2/H3 headings

- GIVEN the landing content sections
- WHEN their headings are inspected
- THEN the key H2/H3 headings are phrased as questions (query-matchable, RCI-5/RPL-8)

#### Scenario: Date on content, byline in the global footer

- GIVEN a content section on the landing
- WHEN it renders
- THEN it carries a real `datePublished` value (never a placeholder)
- AND the author byline with class `.byline` renders in the global footer (asserted in `footer.test.tsx` / shell render — not in the page-only render)

#### Scenario: Every image has alt text

- GIVEN all `<img>` elements on the landing
- WHEN they are inspected
- THEN each has a non-empty `alt` attribute describing the image

### Requirement: Comparative Table (LND-14)

The landing MUST render a comparison table (product vs alternatives / feature comparison) whose cells carry real Relevy facts — tables earn citability structure points (RCI-5) and AI extraction (RPL-10). The table MUST keep semantic `<table>` markup; on viewports narrower than the table's content width the section MUST remain horizontally scrollable (`overflow-x-auto` wrapper + a `min-w` on the table) so columns stay legible instead of squeezing.
(Previously: table rendered at full width inside an `overflow-hidden` wrapper — illegible on mobile.)

#### Scenario: Comparison table present

- GIVEN the landing page
- WHEN the comparison section renders at a 360px viewport
- THEN a semantic `<table>` with at least 3 rows of real comparison data is present
- AND the section is horizontally scrollable with a min-width table (columns keep legible width, no cell squeeze)

#### Scenario: No invented cells

- GIVEN the comparison table
- WHEN its cells are inspected
- THEN every value traces to real product facts (no placeholder or fabricated numbers)

### Requirement: Weight Copy Accuracy v3.1.0 (LND-15)

When the landing copy references dimension weights, then every percentage MUST match the v3.1.0 engine weights: citability 24%, E-E-A-T 23%, acceso de bots 15%, datos estructurados 12%, plataforma 14%, autoridad de marca 12%. The brand authority references MUST read "12 %" and "octava parte" — never "20 %" or "quinta parte". The copy MUST NOT contain any stale v3.0.0 value (22,4 / 19,2 / 16 / 20 / 11,2). The "24 puntos" (E-E-A-T rubric, not a weight) and "12 criterios" (schema criteria count, not a weight) references MUST remain unchanged. `copy.test.ts` MUST be co-updated in the same change.

#### Scenario: All weight references match v3.1.0

- GIVEN the hero, features[01-06], and FAQ copy
- WHEN every weight reference is inspected
- THEN each matches 24/23/15/12/14/12
- AND no stale v3.0.0 value (22,4/19,2/16/20/11,2) appears anywhere

#### Scenario: Brand reads octava parte

- GIVEN features[06] and faq[4] (brand authority)
- WHEN their weight copy is inspected
- THEN they read "12 %" and "octava parte" (no "20 %" / "quinta parte")

#### Scenario: Rubric and criteria counts untouched

- GIVEN the E-E-A-T and schema feature cards
- WHEN their non-weight copy is inspected
- THEN "24 puntos" (E-E-A-T rubric) and "12 criterios" (schema) remain unchanged

#### Scenario: copy.test.ts passes with v3.1.0

- GIVEN the co-updated assertions
- WHEN `pnpm test` runs
- THEN `copy.test.ts` passes asserting the v3.1.0 values (no stale 20% / "quinta parte")

### Requirement: Case Study Section (LND-16)

When the landing renders, then it MUST include a Case Study section between the comparison table and the FAQ, in document order. The heading MUST be an H2 reading exactly "Case Study: ¿Cómo mejoramos el GEO Score de nuestro propio sitio?" — ending in "?" (citability question-form bonus) and containing "Case Study" (experience case-heading bonus). The body MUST be neutral Spanish (no English phrases, no voseo/tuteo), 50-200 words, a third-person honest dogfooding narrative using ONLY verified numbers: the 14-URL corpus (Relevy 55 vs moz 57, promedio 42.4), the total GEO 47 → 62 during 2026, 6 engines and <30s per URL. The body MUST NOT contain "92" nor any unverified figure, MUST NOT conflate the E-E-A-T dimension (46) with the corpus total, and MUST NOT repeat exact-match strings asserted elsewhere (platform names, six domain names, FAQ questions) so existing `getByText` assertions stay unique.

#### Scenario: Section renders between comparison and FAQ

- GIVEN the landing page
- WHEN the sections are inspected in document order
- THEN a Case Study H2 renders after the comparison table and before the FAQ section

#### Scenario: Heading matches the locked question form

- GIVEN the Case Study heading
- WHEN it is inspected
- THEN it reads exactly "Case Study: ¿Cómo mejoramos el GEO Score de nuestro propio sitio?" (ends in "?")

#### Scenario: Spanish neutral body in the 50-200 word band

- GIVEN the Case Study body
- WHEN it is inspected
- THEN it is between 50 and 200 words, neutral Spanish (no English phrases; passes the `VOSEO_PATTERN` invariant), and self-contained with an explicit subject lead

#### Scenario: Verified numbers only

- GIVEN the Case Study body
- WHEN its figures are inspected
- THEN every number belongs to the verified set (14 URLs, 55/57/42.4, 47→62, 2026, 6, <30)
- AND it contains no "92", no unverified claims, and no "46→55"-style dimension/total conflation

### Requirement: Changelog Section (LND-17)

When the landing renders, then it MUST include a Changelog section immediately after the Case Study section. The heading MUST be an H2 reading exactly "Changelog" (matches the engine's changelog heading pattern → +10 experience proxy). The section MUST list the three real engine versions in semver format, one line each, naming what changed: v3.1.0 (sprint 14 — calibración de pesos y bandas, citability v3.1), v3.0.0 (sprint 13 — dimensión autoridad de marca), v2.0.0 (sprint 9 — primer modelo de puntuación calibrado). The version lines MUST keep the block in the 50-200 word band (semver strings also hit the citability `STAT_PATTERN`).

#### Scenario: Changelog heading present

- GIVEN the landing page
- WHEN it renders
- THEN an H2 reading exactly "Changelog" renders immediately after the Case Study section

#### Scenario: Three real versions in semver

- GIVEN the changelog list
- WHEN it is inspected
- THEN it lists exactly v3.1.0, v3.0.0 and v2.0.0 with one honest line each (what changed, no invented version)

#### Scenario: Block stays in the extraction band

- GIVEN the changelog block
- WHEN its word count is measured
- THEN it contains between 50 and 200 words

### Requirement: Interleaved Section Backgrounds (LND-18)

When the landing renders, then the section backgrounds MUST follow an alternating gray/white rhythm that breaks the former four-gray-section run (S5 Comparativa → S5b Case Study → S6 FAQ → S7 CTA): S4 (Plataformas) MUST render on the gray base with a white `rounded-2xl` recuadro wrapping the platform grid; S5 (Comparativa) MUST render as a `border-y` white band; S5b (Case Study) MUST render on the gray base wrapped in a white `rounded-2xl` recuadro; S6 (FAQ) MUST render as a `border-y` white band; S7 (CTA) keeps the gray base with its existing white `rounded-2xl` recuadro. No two adjacent sections within that run MUST NOT share the same background surface. Any eyebrow rendered on a gray surface MUST use `#475569` or darker (WCAG AA ≥ 4.5:1 on `#f8fafc`); eyebrows on white bands MAY keep `#64748b`. The platforms grid MUST keep EXACTLY 6 `div.rounded-xl` cards — new recuadros MUST use `rounded-2xl`, never `rounded-xl`. The comparison table's horizontal-scroll wrapper MUST remain `overflow-x-auto` (MUST NOT become `overflow-hidden`) with the table keeping `min-w-[640px]`; any recuadro MUST wrap OUTSIDE that wrapper. Background and recuadro changes MUST NOT alter the section content or the extracted citability text.

#### Scenario: Four-gray run broken

- GIVEN the landing sections from S5 (Comparativa) through S7 (CTA)
- WHEN their background surfaces are inspected
- THEN S5 and S6 render as white bands, S5b as gray with a white recuadro, and S7 as gray with its white recuadro
- AND no two adjacent sections in the run share the same background

#### Scenario: Platforms grid keeps exactly 6 rounded-xl cards

- GIVEN the platforms section (S4) with its white `rounded-2xl` recuadro on the gray base
- WHEN the section is inspected
- THEN it contains EXACTLY 6 `div.rounded-xl` cards (the recuadro is `rounded-2xl`, not `rounded-xl`)

#### Scenario: Case Study wrapped in a white recuadro

- GIVEN the Case Study section (S5b) on the gray base
- WHEN it renders
- THEN its content is wrapped in a white `rounded-2xl` recuadro

#### Scenario: Eyebrow contrast on gray bands

- GIVEN any eyebrow rendered on a gray surface
- WHEN its text color is inspected
- THEN it is `#475569` or darker (≥ 4.5:1 on `#f8fafc`)
- AND no gray-surface eyebrow uses `#64748b`

#### Scenario: Comparison table wrapper stays overflow-x-auto

- GIVEN the comparison section (S5) on the white band
- WHEN the table renders
- THEN `table.parentElement` keeps `overflow-x-auto` (never `overflow-hidden`)
- AND the table keeps `min-w-[640px]`

### Requirement: Article JSON-LD with Real Data (LND-19.2)

When the landing page renders, then it MUST emit a third JSON-LD block with `@type: "Article"` (NOT "TechArticle" — only `article`/`newsarticle`/`blogposting` fire the publisher signal in `classify.ts:109-115`). The Article node MUST be populated with real Relevy data from `copy.ts`/`brand.ts`: `headline` equal to the Case Study heading ("Case Study: ¿Cómo mejoramos el GEO Score de nuestro propio sitio?"), `datePublished` "2026-08-20", `dateModified` "2026-08-28", `author` = `FOUNDER` (name + sameAs), `publisher` = Organization Relevy (`BRAND_NAME` + `APP_URL`), and `url` = `APP_URL`. Emitting this node MUST satisfy the engine's `article_author` criterion (10/10) and MUST make `detectBusinessType` return `publisher` (10/10).

#### Scenario: Article node served with real fields

- GIVEN the landing page
- WHEN its JSON-LD blocks are inspected
- THEN one block has `@type: "Article"` with `headline` matching the Case Study heading, `datePublished` "2026-08-20", `dateModified` "2026-08-28", `author` carrying the FOUNDER name and sameAs, and `publisher` naming Relevy at `relevy.app`
- AND no block uses `@type: "TechArticle"`

#### Scenario: Article satisfies article_author and publisher

- GIVEN the emitted Article node
- WHEN the schema engine scores the served JSON-LD
- THEN `article_author` scores 10/10 (author name + sameAs)
- AND `business_type_schema` scores 10/10 with `detectBusinessType` returning `publisher` (stable, anonymous or authenticated crawl)

### Requirement: Article speakable + case-study element (LND-19.3)

When the landing renders the Article JSON-LD and the Case Study section, then the Article node MUST include a `speakable` property whose `cssSelector` array contains exactly `["#case-study"]`, and the Case Study section container in the served HTML MUST have `id="case-study"` so the selector points to a real element (honesty LND-7). Emitting this MUST satisfy the engine's `speakable` criterion (5/5).

#### Scenario: speakable selector references a real element

- GIVEN the Article JSON-LD block and the served Case Study markup
- WHEN the JSON-LD and the rendered HTML are inspected
- THEN `speakable.cssSelector` equals `["#case-study"]`
- AND an element with `id="case-study"` is present in the served HTML (presence test — no dangling selector)

#### Scenario: speakable criterion satisfied

- GIVEN the Article node with `speakable`
- WHEN the schema engine scores the served JSON-LD
- THEN `speakable` scores 5/5

### Requirement: Award stays honest missing_recommended (LND-19.4)

The `award` property MUST NOT be added to any JSON-LD node — no real award exists and inventing one would violate LND-7. The schema engine MUST keep reporting `missing_recommended` for `award`, and `organization_person` MUST remain 13/15. No test MAY assert an invented award.

#### Scenario: No award emitted, gap documented

- GIVEN the landing JSON-LD
- WHEN it is inspected
- THEN no `award` property appears anywhere
- AND `organization_person` scores 13/15 with `award` documented as `missing_recommended` (honest, never fabricated)

### Requirement: Launch Section (LND-20.1)

When the landing page renders, then it MUST include an honest launch section between the FAQ and the final CTA, in document order, that announces the product and the FREE plan without invented claims. The copy MUST live in `src/lib/copy.ts` (`LANDING_COPY.launch`), be neutral Spanish (passes the `VOSEO_PATTERN` invariant), sit in the 50-200 word band, and follow the existing design system (navy/emerald/amber, Instrument Serif/Work Sans). The copy MUST NOT invent tiers, unshipped features, or external posts.

#### Scenario: Section renders between FAQ and CTA

- GIVEN the landing page
- WHEN the sections are inspected in document order
- THEN a launch section renders after the FAQ and before the final CTA

#### Scenario: Honest live + FREE plan copy

- GIVEN the launch section copy
- WHEN it is inspected
- THEN it states the live product and the FREE plan (10 audits / 30 days)
- AND it makes no invented claims (no paid tiers, no unshipped features, no external posts)

#### Scenario: Copy centralized and ES neutral in the 50-200 band

- GIVEN `LANDING_COPY.launch` in `src/lib/copy.ts`
- WHEN it is inspected
- THEN it is between 50 and 200 words, passes the `VOSEO_PATTERN` invariant, and contains the strings "10 auditorías" and "30 días"

#### Scenario: Design system coherence

- GIVEN the launch section markup
- WHEN it is inspected
- THEN it uses the existing design tokens (`font-serif`, navy/emerald/amber) consistent with the rest of the landing

### Requirement: Starter SVGs Removed (LND-20.2)

When the landing/public assets render, then the starter SVGs without a consumer MUST be removed from `public/`: `next.svg`, `vercel.svg`, `window.svg`, `globe.svg`, `file.svg`. There MUST be zero references to these files in `src/` and `app/`.

#### Scenario: No starter SVGs in public/

- GIVEN `public/`
- WHEN the five starter SVGs are looked up
- THEN `next.svg`, `vercel.svg`, `window.svg`, `globe.svg`, and `file.svg` are absent

#### Scenario: No consumer references break

- GIVEN the repository source
- WHEN references to the five starter SVGs are searched in `src/` and `app/`
- THEN there are zero references
