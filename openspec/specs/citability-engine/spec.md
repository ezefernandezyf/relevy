# Citability Engine Specification

> **Change**: `sprint-11-rebrand-polish` + `sprint-21-citability-i18n` · **Type**: Delta (MODIFIED + ADDED)

## Purpose

Analyze the main textual content of a page to determine how likely AI systems (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini) are to cite or quote passages. Segment content by H2/H3 headings into blocks, score each block across five weighted dimensions, and produce top/bottom block analysis with template-based rewrite suggestions. Since Sprint 21, the pattern constants (`DEFINITION_PATTERN`, `ANSWER_COPULA`, `FIRST_PERSON_LEAD`, `UNIQUENESS_PHRASES`, `PRONOUN_LEAD`, `CONJUNCTION_LEAD`) recognize Spanish (ES) patterns alongside English with identical strength — Spanish definitions, copulas, first-person/uniqueness signals, and bad leads score exactly like their English equivalents (REQ-21.1–REQ-21.5) — so Spanish-language pages are no longer systematically under-scored (relevy.app citability 49.9 → 73.9) with zero changes to weights or `scorer.ts` (REQ-21.5).

## Requirements

### Requirement: Main Content Extraction (RCI-1)

The system MUST extract the primary textual content using Cheerio, excluding known non-content regions.

#### Scenario: Standard article page

- GIVEN a HTML page with `<article>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`, and `<aside class="sidebar">`
- WHEN main content is extracted
- THEN text from `<article>` is included
- AND text from `<nav>`, `<footer>`, and `<aside class="sidebar">` is excluded

#### Scenario: No semantic containers

- GIVEN a HTML page with only `<div>` elements and no `<article>`/`<nav>`/`<footer>`
- WHEN main content is extracted
- THEN the largest text-containing `<div>` is selected
- AND empty or minimal-text divs are excluded

### Requirement: Content Segmentation (RCI-2)

The system MUST segment extracted content by H2/H3 headings into blocks.

#### Scenario: Multiple H2 sections

- GIVEN extracted content with 4 H2 headings, each followed by paragraph text
- WHEN content is segmented
- THEN 4 blocks are produced
- AND each block includes its heading text and the text up to the next H2

#### Scenario: H2 with nested H3

- GIVEN content with H2 "Overview" and two H3 sub-headings beneath it
- WHEN content is segmented
- THEN 3 blocks are produced: one for H2, one per H3
- AND the H2 block contains text before the first H3

### Requirement: Answer Block Quality (RCI-3)

The system MUST score each block for answer-block patterns, awarding partial credit for partial matches (e.g., a definition without an immediate answer, or an answer without a standalone first-60-words) instead of all-or-nothing. Exact thresholds follow the WU-2 calibration decision.
(Previously: binary scoring — full credit only for definition + immediate answer + standalone lead.)

#### Scenario: Definition pattern detected

- GIVEN a block starting with "API rate limiting is a technique used to control…"
- WHEN Answer Block Quality is scored
- THEN the score is ≥ 70 (definition pattern "is" + answer in first sentence)
- AND the first-60-words standalone check contributes positively

#### Scenario: No answer pattern

- GIVEN a block starting with "In this section, we will discuss various features…" (no definition)
- WHEN Answer Block Quality is scored
- THEN the score is < 40 (no definition, no immediate answer)

#### Scenario: Partial answer pattern earns intermediate credit

- GIVEN a block with a definition but the answer buried after 3 sentences
- WHEN Answer Block Quality is scored
- THEN the block earns partial credit (> 0, below full) rather than 0

### Requirement: Self-Containment (RCI-4)

The system MUST score blocks for contextual independence.

#### Scenario: Self-contained block

- GIVEN a block of 120 words starting with "The GeoAudit platform scans websites…" (explicit subject, no pronoun lead)
- WHEN Self-Containment is scored
- THEN the score is ≥ 70 (explicit subject, within 50-200 words)

#### Scenario: Pronoun-led block

- GIVEN a block starting with "It also provides detailed analytics…" (pronoun-lead, no subject)
- WHEN Self-Containment is scored
- THEN the score is < 30 (pronoun-first, requires external context)

### Requirement: Structural Readability (RCI-5)

The system MUST score structural readability with partial credit for partial compliance (e.g., clean hierarchy but no lists/tables, or question-as-heading but paragraphs longer than 4 sentences). Exact thresholds follow the WU-2 calibration decision.
(Previously: full credit only when all sub-checks passed.)

#### Scenario: Partial structure earns intermediate credit

- GIVEN a block with a clean H1>H2>H3 hierarchy but no tables/lists
- WHEN Structural Readability is scored
- THEN the block earns partial credit instead of the minimum

### Requirement: Statistical Density (RCI-6)

The system MUST award intermediate points by stat-density level (percentages, currency, dates, named sources) rather than a binary rich/poor split. Semantic-version strings (`vX.Y.Z`, e.g. "v18.2.0") MUST count as concrete stats in `STAT_PATTERN` so changelog/release-note blocks earn density credit. Exact tiers follow the WU-2 calibration decision.
(Previously: `STAT_PATTERN` matched only percentages, currency amounts, and 4-digit years.)

#### Scenario: Stats-rich block

- GIVEN a 400-word block containing "According to a 2025 McKinsey report, 67% of companies…" and "the average cost is $12,000 per incident"
- WHEN Statistical Density is scored
- THEN the score is ≥ 70 (≥1 stat per 500 words with named source + percentage + dollar amount)

#### Scenario: Partial stat block earns intermediate credit

- GIVEN a 400-word block with one bare percentage but no named source
- WHEN Statistical Density is scored
- THEN the block earns intermediate credit (between 10 and full), not the minimum

#### Scenario: Stats-poor block

- GIVEN a 400-word block with no numbers, percentages, dollar amounts, or named sources
- WHEN Statistical Density is scored
- THEN the score is ≤ 10

#### Scenario: Semver counts as a stat

- GIVEN a 400-word block containing "we released v18.2.0" and no other stat-like tokens
- WHEN Statistical Density is scored
- THEN the version string matches `STAT_PATTERN`
- AND the block earns intermediate credit (not ≤ 10)

### Requirement: Uniqueness (RCI-7)

The system MUST score each block on original-data phrases ("we surveyed…", "our data shows…") and first-person voice — proxy signal. Every scored block MUST earn a base uniqueness credit of 35 (floor) for being an extractable, self-contained passage; each unique-data hit adds 35, capped at 100.
(Previously: score = min(100, hits × 35) — zero hits scored 0, compressing the dimension in 100% of benchmark blocks.)

#### Scenario: Self-contained block earns the floor

- GIVEN a 120-word block with explicit subject and no first-party phrases
- WHEN Uniqueness is scored
- THEN the score is ≥ 35 (base floor), never 0

#### Scenario: One unique-data phrase adds credit

- GIVEN a block containing "our data shows" (one hit)
- WHEN Uniqueness is scored
- THEN the score is ≥ 70 (floor 35 + 35 per hit)

#### Scenario: First-person lead adds credit

- GIVEN a block starting with "We analyzed…" (first-person lead)
- WHEN Uniqueness is scored
- THEN the score is ≥ 70

### Requirement: Top/Bottom Block Output (RCI-10)

The system MUST return the top 3 and bottom 3 blocks with individual dimension scores and excerpts. The bottom 3 MUST be derived from blocks NOT in the top 3, so the two lists are disjoint. When fewer than 3 non-overlapping blocks remain, the system MUST show fewer bottom blocks rather than repeating a top block.
(Previously: top3 and bottom3 were computed independently from the same array and could overlap.)

#### Scenario: Disjoint on long pages

- GIVEN a page with 8 scored blocks
- WHEN top/bottom output is computed
- THEN the top 3 and bottom 3 share no block

#### Scenario: Five blocks → 3 top + 2 bottom

- GIVEN a page with 5 scored blocks
- WHEN top/bottom output is computed
- THEN the top 3 and bottom 2 are disjoint (no overlap)

#### Scenario: Three blocks → 3 top + 0 bottom

- GIVEN a page with exactly 3 scored blocks
- WHEN top/bottom output is computed
- THEN the top 3 is returned and the bottom list is empty (fewer shown, never repeated)

#### Scenario: Four blocks → 3 top + 1 bottom

- GIVEN a page with 4 scored blocks
- WHEN top/bottom output is computed
- THEN the bottom list contains only the 1 block not in the top 3, with no duplication

### Requirement: Citability Coverage (RCI-11)

The system MUST return citability coverage as the percentage of blocks scoring ≥ 60.
(Previously: table-only — coverage counted blocks scoring ≥ 70; 0% coverage in 100% of benchmark sites.)

#### Scenario: Block at 65 counts toward coverage

- GIVEN scored blocks with composites 82, 65, and 40
- WHEN coverage is computed
- THEN 2 of 3 blocks count (82 and 65)
- AND coverage is 67%

### Requirement: Malformed HTML Tolerance (RCI-14)

The system MUST handle malformed HTML without throwing exceptions.

#### Scenario: Unclosed tags

- GIVEN HTML with `<p>` tags that are never closed
- WHEN content is extracted and segmented via Cheerio
- THEN the engine produces scores (Cheerio recovers)
- AND no exception is thrown

#### Scenario: Empty body

- GIVEN HTML with no `<body>` content
- WHEN content extraction runs
- THEN the engine returns a score of 0 with an empty blocks array
- AND no exception is thrown

### Requirement: Spanish Definition Pattern Recognition (REQ-21.1)

`DEFINITION_PATTERN` MUST recognize "es un/una" and "son unos/unas" with the same strength as English "is a/an". A Spanish block containing a definition SHALL earn the definition bonus exactly like an English one.

#### Scenario: Spanish definition earns answer credit

- GIVEN an ES block whose lead starts "Relevy es una plataforma de auditoría GEO/SEO que analiza la visibilidad en buscadores de IA"
- WHEN Answer Block Quality is scored
- THEN the answer score is ≥ 60

#### Scenario: Plural definition "son unos/unas" is recognized

- GIVEN an ES block whose lead contains "estos datos son unas señales directas de autoridad temática"
- WHEN Answer Block Quality is scored
- THEN the answer score is ≥ 60

### Requirement: Spanish Answer Copula Recognition (REQ-21.2)

`ANSWER_COPULA` MUST recognize "es/son/era/eran/fue/fueron" like "is/are/was/were". A Spanish block whose first sentence is complete and declarative SHALL earn the first-sentence answer bonus under the same 60-word rule as English.

#### Scenario: Declarative Spanish first sentence earns the answer bonus

- GIVEN an ES block whose first sentence is "El análisis es completo y cubre las cinco dimensiones de visibilidad."
- WHEN Answer Block Quality is scored
- THEN the answer score is ≥ 60

#### Scenario: Past-tense copula qualifies

- GIVEN an ES block whose first sentence is "El estudio fue realizado sobre 200 sitios en español."
- WHEN Answer Block Quality is scored
- THEN the answer score is ≥ 60

### Requirement: Spanish Uniqueness Signal Recognition (REQ-21.3)

`FIRST_PERSON_LEAD` MUST recognize "nuestro/nuestra/nosotros"; `UNIQUENESS_PHRASES` MUST include "encuestamos, analizamos, nuestro análisis, nuestros datos, nuestra investigación, nuestros hallazgos, encontramos, en nuestra experiencia". Spanish blocks SHALL earn the same per-hit credit as English (floor 35 + 35, cap 100).

#### Scenario: Spanish first-person lead adds credit

- GIVEN an ES block starting "Nosotros encuestamos a 120 especialistas en GEO"
- WHEN Uniqueness is scored
- THEN the score is ≥ 70

#### Scenario: Unique-data phrase in the body adds credit

- GIVEN an ES block whose body contains "según nuestra investigación, los buscadores de IA citan con más frecuencia"
- WHEN Uniqueness is scored
- THEN the score is ≥ 70

### Requirement: Spanish Bad-Lead Penalty (REQ-21.4)

`PRONOUN_LEAD` MUST recognize "esto/eso/aquello/este/esta/estos/estas"; `CONJUNCTION_LEAD` "pero/sin embargo/y además/así que/aunque". A Spanish block led by a pronoun or conjunction SHALL be penalized like an English one — Self-Containment < 30.

#### Scenario: Spanish pronoun lead is penalized

- GIVEN an ES block starting "Esto significa que los buscadores de IA priorizan contenido citable"
- WHEN Self-Containment is scored
- THEN the score is < 30

#### Scenario: Spanish conjunction lead is penalized

- GIVEN an ES block starting "Sin embargo, el estudio solo cubre una muestra pequeña"
- WHEN Self-Containment is scored
- THEN the score is < 30

### Requirement: English Regression Lock (REQ-21.5)

Extending the pattern constants MUST NOT alter English scoring. Every existing EN fixture assertion SHALL keep its exact value.

#### Scenario: Existing EN fixtures keep their exact scores

- GIVEN the English fixtures and assertions (page-definition.html answer 100, page-pronoun-led.html selfContainment 10, page-five-blocks.html pageScore 60.8)
- WHEN the citability suite runs after the pattern extension
- THEN every EN assertion passes unchanged

#### Scenario: English text does not trigger Spanish branches

- GIVEN an EN block "API rate limiting is a technique used to control traffic"
- WHEN Answer Block Quality is scored
- THEN the score equals the pre-change value (English branch only)
